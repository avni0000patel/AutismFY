## 🏫 AutismFY: Routines, Boards & Connections

This application is designed to help parents and caregivers of younger Autistic children create routine boards, log important information, share and connect with other parents and caregives. Parents are able to create a routine board for their respective child, and also share their boards and other information about the child with doctors, therapists, teachers...etc. In this project we will build and design this app using the React, create our own server-side API, add user authentication, and connect to a database.
