## 🏫 AutismFY: Routines, Boards & Connections

This application is designed to help parents and caregivers of younger Autistic children create routine To-Do Lists, log important information in a Notes tab, share and connect with other parents and caregivers by creating posts. In this project we will build and design this app using the React, create our own server-side API, add user authentication, and connect to a database.

## ✍️User Story:

```
As a Parent I want to be able to open and navigate a webpage
The webpage provides a login window
Once I provide my credentials, I am logged into my portal
In my portal I can see my profile with my posts, or a newsfeed with my friends posts
I am able to click on To-Do tab and enter a list of tasks or routines
I am able to delete or update a routine item
In my portal I am also able to see Notes tab and enter a note
I am able to delete or drag the note anywhere on the page and it will persist
```
